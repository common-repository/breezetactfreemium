BreezeTact is a plugin meant to enhance user experience on mobile devices to get better conversions.

== Description ==

BreezeTact adds quick call-to-actions on mobile i.e. phone, email, map and lets users get in touch at the click of a button. Users have the ability to select background color of their choice for the icons as well as color of the icons. The 3 icons would show at the bottom on mobile devices. After the installation, the background color for the icons and other information such as phone number, email and map location can be set up. The BreezeTact watermark would show in the admin settings page as well as the frontend underneath the icons if it is enabled through the admin settings by checking the "Enable Watermark". Otherwise, it is hidden by default.
